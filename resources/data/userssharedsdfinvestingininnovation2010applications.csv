Project Description, objectives and proposed outcomes: The proposed project is a large-scale randomized control study of 60 schools all of whom have committed interest in implementing the MicroSociety situated learning environment to validate the capacity of the model to increase student achievement and prepare students, by the end of 8th grade, for a pathway of success in college and beyond. The project will specifically: (1) Produce student outcomes in 8th grade that indicate a statistically significant higher degree of college and career readiness than a control group with an effect size > .30. (2) Create 30 new situated learning middle school environments (MicroSociety) leading to high student engagement and prove that this was a causal factor in goal #1 using a Randomized Control Trial (RCT) design. (3) Assist states in their transition to further refine their college and career readiness standards by identifying a key strategy - the use of a situated learning environment - to achieve these standards. The total number of students to be served by this project is 67,500 in states represented by key LEA partners listed above.

Program Model for Improving Children's Literacy Skills,Minneapolis,MN,55418,"""A Chance To Grow (ACTG) requests a Developmental Grant for SMART   a school-based intervention that promotes brain stem functioning and improves learning capacities in young children.  SMART has demonstrated that it can produce reading gains and close achievement gaps between students of different income and racial groups.  In i3, ACTG will expand SMART to 30 schools in three states.  SMART has two overarching objectives: (1) the SMART curriculum, along with ongoing mentoring, will produce greater teacher effectiveness, and (2) more effective teachers will result in greater student achievement and growth and a reduction in achievement gaps between groups of students.  SMART is a teacher development approach that provides elementary teachers with a tool kit (SMART curriculum) that facilitates early learning, promotes movement, and provides ongoing forums for teachers to address classroom leadership issues into 30 schools in three states.  SMART is designed to be integrated into the daily classroom schedule and administered by regular teachers.  ACTG provides a week-long summer training in SMART curriculum, how to integrate SMART into the daily classroom, and, training in learner-centered approaches and classroom leadership skills.  SMART also provides to teachers up to three years of mentoring from former educators trained in SMART and learner-centered approaches.  7,500 to 10,000 students will be involved over a period of five years. Using University of Denver's experimental research design, reading tests will be used to assess reading levels and gains in phonemic awareness, phonics, vocabulary, fluency, and comprehension. Teacher effectiveness will be measured by classroom observations and teacher, parent, and student surveys.  Official partners are the University of Denver and the 30 participating LEA schools in MN, SD, and WI.""",AP1: Effective Teachers and Principals,CP5: Early Learning,Nonprofit w/ consortium of schools,Development,5 years,4993905,No,"Minneapolis, MN

Admission Possible,Admission Possible College Access Program,Saint Paul,MN,55104,"""Admission Possible, partnering with Milwaukee Public Schools and five schools in the Twin Cities, seeks a Development Grant of $5 million to support the growth of our program to serve nearly 12,000 students over the next 5 years. This effort will serve low-income high school students as they prepare for and earn admission to college by providing test preparation services, college application support, help with financial aid and scholarships, and guidance in the college transition. Over the past 10 years, our students have seen ACT score increases of more than 20%; 98% have been admitted to college; and more than 80% of our college students remain enrolled in college or have earned their degree. Our key innovation is using a national service model to increase college access; this approach allows us to provide intensive services at a low cost that makes it scaleable. Last June, President Obama commended our work by stating, 'Admission Possible operates in just two states now.  So imagine if it was 10, or 20, or 50.' This grant would support growth of our innovative program to serve additional students in the Twin Cities, Milwaukee, and a third site. A random assignment evaluation will be used to demonstrate the program's effectiveness; funding for the evaluation has been identified and the evaluator, Dr. Chris Avery of Harvard Kennedy School, has been secured. As an AmeriCorps program, Admission Possible has raised $4 of private sector support for each federal dollar awarded and a history of sustainable growth. Our record of success, ability to leverage private funds, and singular focus on the important national goal of college access lead us to seek this federal support to expand our efforts to serve many more of the 200,000 low-income high school students who could go to college every year, but don't.

The system will also allow for the acquisition and implementation of an instructional improvement system that allows teachers to create common and formative assessments which will be used to identify potentially high risk students.  A data coach will be employed at each school in the district to provide job embedded professional development for teachers.  The data coaches and principals will provide differentiated professional development to teachers based on observation data based on Robert Marzano's 41 key strategies related to effective teaching. The electronic platform, iObservation, will collect, manage, and report data for instructional leaders and teachers to make informed decisions.  Data coaches will model effective instructional strategies based on the data collected during classroom walkthroughs.

RAP Scholars was initiated with the goal of decreasing the documented achievement gap between Caucasian students and their African American and Hispanic counterparts. This program is offered to economically disadvantaged/underserved 8th grade students and African American and Hispanic students (who do not fall under the economic category) who are transitioning to one of the three Ann Arbor High Schools and who, through grade point averages and test scores, have shown academic promise.The RAP Scholars program has three main goals: 1) to address achievement disparities by Raising the Academic Performance (RAP) of under-served but high achieving students; 2) to enroll selected students into accelerated (AC) and advanced placement (AP) courses and receive a score of 4 or 5 on the AP exams; and 3) to academically prepare and enroll these students into top ranked college and universities. The RAP Scholars are divided into cohorts of 20-25 and will remain in those cohorts with a trained University of Michigan college student mentor. The mentor will provide in-depth one-on-one guidance through their learning experiences inside and outside the classroom until graduation (estimate 585 RAP Scholars over the project duration with 585 in the comparison group a total N= 1,170).

These world-renowned investigators encourage us to ponder big questions that may eventually lead us to big discoveries.QUEST will develop, implement, evaluate and refine 10 multi-media modules, as well as evaluate the effectiveness of the Cycle Q instructional model that has big questions as its central core.  Each module will focus on a different big question theme, such as ?Is there life on other planets??  QUEST module development teams will consist of middle school teachers and their classes, Origins? scientists and graduate researchers, and science education specialists.  Additionally, this project will involve an extensive evaluation team and a technology development team to create interactive computer simulations, videos and other multi-media components for the QUEST modules.  QUEST is a collaborative project between Arizona State University (including the College of Teacher Education and Leadership (CTEL), the Origins Initiative and the Technology Based Learning and Research Center), Pendergast Elementary School District and Madison Elementary School District.

Our expected outcomes are: (1) Produce fifty-five curriculum units with embedded performance assessment tasks across the core content areas in grades 6, 7 and 8 that build deep literacy and numeracy skills while systematically developing critical thinking, metacognitive skills and global competence; (2) Generate quantitative and qualitative evidence of implementation of Project and demonstrable  improvements in performance, critical thinking skills, motivation, and cultural competence; and (3) Produce and disseminate digital tools, resources, and a professional development regimen that can be used at scale in varied contexts.The Project will pilot in Asia Society's International Studies Schools Network (ISSN) and will be implemented in 6 existing or new ISSN schools: 3 schools in two urban school districts (Denver and New York City), 1 charter school (Philadelphia), and two rural schools (Texas and Mississippi).""",AP3: High Standards and High-Quality Assessments,"CP6: College Access and Success College Access and Success, CP8: Rural LEAs",Nonprofit w/ consortium of schools,Development,4 years,4296907,No,"New York, NY

The CBP aligns the curriculum to systematically reflect the state standards, matches assessments to curriculum, and provides data to inform decisions regarding the delivery and realignment of instruction. Though benchmark systems are typically authentic, timely and relevant, we have noted that they lack the rigor and the reflective diagnostic nature that results in teachers knowing what to teach with the means to assess and maintain the instructional assessment cycle: the hallmark of our innovation.	This process, when implemented in math over a four-year period, resulted in increased student achievement and teacher performance and productivity in the delivery of the content. It is the district's hypothesis that the CBP system can be replicated into other content areas.  Students have been unsuccessful in their ability to demonstrate LAL content knowledge on high stakes tests even though a strong professional development framework for teaching LAL exists. To this end, we propose to apply the model in LAL to close the achievement gap for all students.Since our District fits the grant description of a high-needs student population, it is our position that when students make consistent gains and the gap closes, they will have greater opportunities for college access and success, affirming, 'an informed populace will have an opportunity to enhance their lives and the society in which they live' (Doctor, 1994).The District will build upon the promising results from the math CBP to expand this process to our early learners as the focus has previously been on students in grades 3-8.

Those identified as at-risk have significantly lower graduation rates than the general student population, despite concerted efforts to address their challenges. This proposal addresses the need to know what interventions are most successful with at-risk students, what interventions are most effective within different subgroups, and the need to design a District-wide system to ensure that no student will fall through the cracks while enrolled in AISD. We believe the solution to these needs lies in designing an Advanced Case Management system with automated workflow and analytic capabilities to manage resource allocation, provide status and exception reports, and track interventions (both AISD-driven and those provided by community partners) longitudinally to establish efficacy. This proposal will marry our current Impact system, which requires an in-depth analysis of the challenges facing individual at-risk students, with our Youth Services Mapping, which provides educators with the academic, social, and emotional services available for at-risk youth. Students can thereby be matched with the most effective services to meet their needs and their progress can be tracked through school and through the service providers.With i3 funds, AISD will address these barriers to full implementation, developing an enhanced early intervention process for at-risk students within the District, by working with International Business Machines (IBM) to develop an Advanced Case Management (ACM) solution.

Baltimore City Public Schools (City Schools) believes that parents have an essential role to play in this process: there is clear and extensive evidence from published research that parental involvement and engagement in a child's education are factors that are strongly associated with higher academic performance. In order to support their children's schooling, however, parents themselves need a good understanding of the educational process and what types of help and support their children need in order to successfully complete each stage. Living in overwhelmingly income-segregated neighborhoods, many of City Schools families have very few - if any - people anywhere in their social network who have successfully navigated all stages of this path. The purpose of this project is to remove this fundamental roadblock to improving academic achievement among the children and young people of Baltimore by ensuring that all parents within the City are provided with the information, resources and support needed to understand and effectively engage with every stage of their children's education. This project holds an ambitious set of expectations about what parents hope for their children and what they can contribute concretely to their children's success in school.

The School Quality Review provides the means for City Schools to capture the qualitative essence of good teaching and leadership by conducting a two-day visit using trained reviewers and a protocol aligned to research-based practices. Through the implementation of the SQR next year (SY 2010-2011), City Schools will (1) measure a school's quality of instructional and operational activities, and (2) transform its efforts in strategically supporting the needs of schools through intense action planning and monitoring. This proposal seeks funds to support the execution of the School Quality Review. The SQR gathers specific information at the school level and addresses the following priorities: 1.	Define quality of instruction, management, support, and culture within the Baltimore context;2.	Measure the degree to which these schools exhibit the qualities expected by City Schools;3.	Develop a performance management system for schools that will have them create action plans linking priorities to measurable outcomes; and 4.

Baltimore City Public Schools,Baltimore Career Ladder,Baltimore,MD,21202,"""The hallmark of an educational system is the academic achievement of its students.  A growing body of research strongly suggests that an essential component of student achievement is sustained access to highly-effective teachers. Effective teachers do not necessarily have the most years in the classroom or the most advanced degrees listed after their names.  Instead, they share their passion for the education process with their students, facilitating the students' success both in the classroom and based on standardized measures.Effective teachers must be developed and nurtured along their professional journey.  It is incumbent on City Schools to enhance their competencies, cultivate their abilities to share their skills with peers, and constantly rekindle their passion for teaching.  Effective teachers who demonstrate all these qualities are in the best position to promote the academic success of City Schools students and so must be compensated fairly-even richly-for City Schools to attract and retain them.City Schools currently is working to change that in a revolutionary way.  City Schools will apply funds from the i3 Development Grant to the creation of the Career Ladder, a comprehensive professional development and compensation framework supported by multilayered, interconnected data systems that track the direct effect of professional development activities on student achievement.  The Career Ladder will benefit not only the ways by which City Schools rewards highly effective teachers, it also will have data-driven applications across and beyond the City Schools system-from tracking student achievements and shortcomings, to developing new opportunities for teacher enrichment, to partnering City Schools students with area businesses for real-world internship and learning opportunities.""",AP1: Effective Teachers and Principals,"CP5: Early Learning, CP6: College Access and Success College Access and Success, CP7: Unique Learning Needs",LEA,Development,3 years,5089782,Yes,"Baltimore, MD

The Intercollegiate Studies Institute in its third report on civic literacy, Our Fading Heritage noted 'There is an epidemic of historical, political and economic ignorance in America'. In underserved communities, the problem is even more serious, as alienation from the civic process infects general academic performance, even as a growing body of research shows that engaging students on their values and aspirations can have dramatic impacts on overall grades and test scores.  Respected sources put the costs of these achievement gaps at $400-700 billion per year to our economy. Current programs do not address the unique developmental needs and interests of middle-school students, nor do they engage teachers who have a limited knowledge of history or the core values of our democracy. Middle school is an appropriate time to introduce students to the knowledge, skills, and attitudes that are essential to the functioning of a democratic society. The Barat Education Foundation has worked with a team of educators and technology specialists to develop a 21st century media-rich model to teach civics and citizenship to middle school students: Our American Voice (OAV).

These Academic Coaches work in small groups, using research-based materials and strategies that focus on building the self-esteem, engagement, and self-awareness that best support student learning. While the specific schedules for these coaching sessions are organized at the discretion of the individual schools, the supplemental nature of each program, and the fact that students are identified using multiple data sources, including local and nationally normed assessments, mean that this project can serve as part of a Tier II Response to Intervention model.	The goals of this program are: 1) to ensure that elementary students meet grade level expectations in math and English as measured using both local and state assessment tools, 2) to increase the growth rate for student performance as measured using state assessments, 3) to support students from traditionally under-performing subgroups as they take on the challenge of more advanced classes.

BPL will employ its school design--currently employed in 70 BPL schools throughout the US--in creating in Tulsa a comprehensive K-12 system of innovative alternative schools that are open to all students within the district. BPL schools consistently achieve significant gains in attendance, deep engagement, behavior, and performance on a variety of standardized and non-traditional measures. This i3 project will permit BPL to go to the next level of rigor (validity and reliability) in outcome evaluation by undertaking a comprehensive and rigorous evaluation that provides valid and reliable information regarding the efficacy of the BPL design. 	By the end of the four-year project, BPL will implement its design in 17 schools and programs in the Tulsa Public Schools, serving approximately 3300 students and approximately 380 teachers in grades K-12. Our objective is to achieve statistically significant gains in student performance on such indicators as academic skills performance, college and career readiness skills, and college access, persistence, and success for those students participating in the turnaround initiative. During year four of the project, BPL will scale the project in three additional school districts (Brockton, Newark, and San Francisco).	BPL will provide professional development and in-school coaching to each of the schools and train and support TPS school coaches in order to institutionalize and expand the alternative system beyond the project period. The BPL support design will make extensive use of high quality online learning and related technology applications to support effective teaching within the BPL design.""",AP4: Persistently Low-Performing Schools,CP6: College Access and Success College Access and Success,Nonprofit w/ LEA,Development,4 years,4984584,No,"Providence, RI

BEST will provide Chicago elementary schools with professional development support and resources to impact school-wide literacy by building the school's own capacity to develop and support on-going, high quality professional development.  In effect, schools develop capacity for future instructional improvement at a new level of productivity and efficiency.  The ultimate beneficiaries are students who will have highly-qualified teachers working in an effective school environment each and every school year.  At demonstration and scale-up sites, teachers improve literacy instructional practices across the curriculum by: (1) attending summer institutes and workshops focused on research-based literacy best practices (2) assuming leadership roles by leading study groups, functioning as peer coaches, and collaborating with colleagues and their principals to set new directions for school reform in literacy and other content areas; and (3) participating in study groups, peer coaching, and reflective dialogue. Students engage in learning activities that improve their attitude about reading, improve their comprehension of text, and increase their standardized test scores.  Project objectives: (1) establish a system of collaboration among the partners; (2) increase teacher professional capacity in literacy instruction; (3) develop teacher leadership and collaboration to provide a sustainable infrastructure for continuous improvement and instructional change; (4) improve the academic outcomes of Northern Illinois students; (5) validate the BEST model at 10 demonstration site schools in Northern Illinois; and (6) scale-up the BEST model to schools, teachers, and students across Northern Illinois.""",AP4: Persistently Low-Performing Schools,,Nonprofit w/ consortium of schools,Development,5 years,4099456,No,"Chicago, IL

Enabling youth to successfully prepare for college is an enormous task that must be addressed in a comprehensive manner.  These efforts must begin long before high school.  To be truly successful, efforts should begin when a child enters kindergarten.  Approaching our final goal of attending college can be achieved by tracking this goal in reverse.  	In order to attend college, youth must graduate.  Graduating on time increases the likelihood they will attend college.  In order to graduate on time, youth need to succeed in school.  In order to succeed in school, they need to avoid at-risk behavior, attend school regularly and receive the educational support they need.  All of this must begin early and continue throughout high school.  The Boys & Girls Club of Cabarrus County recognizes these needs and responds with programs that benefit youth at each critical stage during their school years.   With the implementation of 'High School in 4 and Then More' we will take these efforts to a new level.  Youth are bombarded daily by negative influences that are specifically marketed to them.  We plan to use the power of marketing to make a positive impact on young people.  'High School in 4 and The More' will be introduced to youth from Kindergarten on as they join the Boys & Girls Club.  Posters will appear at our facilities and be distributed throughout the community.  Youth will receive t-shirts with this logo and the pledge 'I will graduate. Class of 20--.'  This will of course relate to their individual graduation year.

Boys & Girls Club of St. Joseph County, in collaboration with the South Bend Community School Corporation (LEA) and numerous community partners, will demonstrate how providing an innovative continuum of externally provided services, including early childhood interventions, will significantly improve the academic achievement of high need students in the identified persistently low-performing schools. Rather than working from the inside out - starting with the schools themselves - curriculum, professional development and programming - the Club is proposing that this project will work from the outside in - starting with the community and families, delivering the social supports necessary to address the critical - but often overlooked - barriers to education that exist for families living in poverty.  The services will target three critical developmental stages: birth through pre-school, Kindergarten through second grade, and third through eighth grade. This approach will rapidly and directly help the interventions by connecting the kids most at risk with the supports they need and allow programs to be more efficiently targeted so fewer kids fall through the cracks. While this process will benefit every student, the impact on students of color and students living in poverty will be especially profound. Children who are actively involved in programming will have significantly more optimal academic outcomes, as well as more positive rates of change over the course of the interventions, than children receiving more typical supports in the control schools.

Our approach has proven to be particularly effective for students with disabilities, approximately 20% of our student body.  We believe that the key to the success of our school model is the blending of our intensive arts education programming and collaborative co-teaching.  The integration of these two non-traditional instructional strategies allows us to use a variety of instructional practices and strategies to effectively meet the diverse needs of all individual learners in our underserved school community.  While this combination of practices has not been widely adopted or extensively evaluated, our student achievement results strongly suggest that an investment in the further development and systematic study of our innovative school model will demonstrate its potential to increase the success of under-represented students in academically rigorous courses.""",AP3: High Standards and High-Quality Assessments,CP7: Unique Learning Needs,LEA,Development,5 years,1847800,No,"Bronx, NY

Continued success will require our educational system to adopt modern methods and means to remain effective and relevant in a 21st century marked by innovation, knowledge, technology, and global competition.  The Promoting Higher Youth in Science through Interactive Computer Systems (PHYSICS) provides preparation for any type of postsecondary education that requires strong academic foundations without the need for academic remediation. PHYSICS is a program that enables students, teachers and schools to promote critical thinking skills. The PHYSICS program creates a discourse in the highest need area of science, physics and physical science. The need for Physics teachers is a national priority as teachers retire and fewer than 1:200 teachers are certified in Physics nationally. We focus on providing students the opportunity to first experience labs through simulations followed by work in the physical lab.  We believe this results in a significant improvement in long-term academic retention of knowledge and skills. To gain scientific literacy, students need to understand basic scientific concepts as well as the process that has been used to gain and refine such concepts over time. This means teachers need to be able to provide opportunities for students to participate in the complete practice of science and to ?support and engage active learners in the process of doing scientific inquiry.? (Barab and Leuhmann 2002, 445). The PHYSICS model targets a deeper understanding of the practices within science which allows teachers to more successfully conduct authentic experiences in their classrooms and help students build their own scientific habits of mind and critical thinking skills.

At the same time, Carteret County Schools recognizes the importance of promoting careers in science, math and engineering to strengthen student academic achievement, provide students with a career focus, strengthen partnerships with industry, revitalize the workforce, and help secure our future in Eastern North Carolina as well as nationally.Our goal is to provide engineering education to our high school students preparing them to major in engineering at the postsecondary level and return to our community to pursue engineering as a career.  In an effort to serve our students as well as our community, our objective is to establish a CTP Engineering Career Pathway at the high school level and an A.A.S. in Engineering degree at Carteret Community College.  Our strategy to accomplish our objective is to bring engineering into our schools by offering Project Lead the Way (PLTW.)   PLTW provides high tech, problem-solving based courses which will bring science, CTE, and technology education into the 21st Century as well as prepare our students for a career in engineering. As educators we understand that students will have more success with more exposure to curriculum therefore we would like to begin the initial program education rot  the student at the middle school level.  If we can engage middle school students in creatve problem based learning while teaching math, science and technology success is attainable.""",AP3: High Standards and High-Quality Assessments,"CP5: Early Learning, CP6: College Access and Success College Access and Success, CP7: Unique Learning Needs",LEA,Development,4 years,2859160,No,"Beaufort, NC

Algebra READY will serve students in grades 3-8 at 3 elementaries and 2 junior highs.Description and Unique Aspects: Algebra READY provides teachers the ability to synchronize instruction to the ongoing development of their students? needs throughout the year. By connecting formative assessment data with sophisticated conceptual grouping strategies and high quality digital investigations coupled with facilitated discourse, Algebra READY provides a comprehensive mathematics program, encouraging not only intervention but acceleration. Algebra READY begins by taking a snapshot of student mathematical understanding using a digital diagnostic tool. The diagnostic tool provides teachers a map of students? gradients of understanding across the continuum of critical benchmarks of algebra readiness. Software utilizes the map to ?intelligently sort? students, supporting teachers? flexible grouping of students according toindividual student needs. Teachers bring meaningful mathematics to the classroom using investigative lessons capitalizing on open source multimedia that engage and inspire students while encouraging mathematical discourse. The teachers act as facilitators rather than lecturers. Throughout the year, formative assessment spotlights students? understandings and misconceptions, making ?students? thinking visible? (NCTM, 2000). This provides teachers with next steps personalized to individual needs. All program features are delivered digitally through one-to-one netbooks, utilizing open source multimedia supported by a flexible digital platform.

The program's goals are to improve math achievement of high-needs students; increase math content knowledge among K-12 teachers; and increase the number of highly effective teachers entering the field.Anchoring the program are bi-weekly seminars among university faculty, secondary math teachers, and undergraduates. These seminars provide the forum for integrating mathematics content and pedagogy, for structuring early field experiences, and for enriching participants' mathematical understanding.  For example, in a seminar on mathematical misconceptions in algebra, participants analyze common wrong answers and discuss ways to help students understand how to avoid these errors.  Participants deepen their own understandings of the mechanics of algebra and discuss pedagogy.  Linked to the seminar is an early field experience: undergraduate participants tutor two hours a week with high-needs seventh, eighth and ninth graders in a two-hour 'Connections to Algebra' class. The seminar assists tutors by teaching them how to incorporate high-level mathematical thinking and pedagogy into the 'Connections' curriculum. To complete the circle, high school 'Connections' students are trained to themselves tutor second graders at nearby high-needs elementary schools.  This requires these struggling high school students to master mathematical concepts at a higher level. It also allows them to be a role model for the younger students. The basic structure of the program is in place at Chico High School in partnership with CSU,C.

Children's Literacy Initiative,Children,Philadelphia,PA,19103,"""Project Description: Children?s Literacy Initiative (CLI) created a teacher professional development program that includes three years of trainings, intensive coaching, high-quality instructional tools, and professional learning communities that help students reach the critical milestone of reading on grade level by the end of 3rd grade. CLI trains all K-3 teachers in a school in high-impact literacy instruction and establishes shared standards of practice; identifies, recruits, and develops one Model Classroom teacher per grade, who receives more intensive coaching and learning community support, preparing them to help colleagues master literacy standards of practice long after CLI?s intervention is complete; and ensures school leaders know how to leverage the Model Classroom to sustain and expand excellent literacy instruction. Research meeting criteria for moderate evidence shows that CLI has helped increase student achievement and close the gaps between high need students and peers. Project Objectives & Outcomes: CLI will demonstrate how its intervention can be taken to scale within a district and replicated regionally and across the country to improve student achievement, increase the number of highly effective teachers, use metrics to set standards of practice, and have a spillover effect that builds a school-wide culture of excellent literacy instruction. Target Number of Students: CLI will train 456 teachers in grades K-3 in 38 randomly-selected public schools in four districts in geographically distinct areas of the US, reaching 45,600 students during the five year grant period. Partners: CLI will work with Camden City Public Schools, Chicago Public Schools, Newark Public Schools, and the School District of Philadelphia.

Since beginning the SLC process in 2002, our high school has significantly narrowed achievement gaps, and increased the graduation rate, moving the high school from an Ohio rating of Academic Watch in 2004 to Effective in 2009. Moving School from a Noun to a Verb, an i3 Development Grant proposal, is designed to take personalized learning another step, providing access to technological tools and a learning platform 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by expanding our wireless network throughout the community. Every student will have free, safe access to the internet and the district?s network from their home or from any other part in the community. More than 3,400 students in grades 6-12 already have district-distributed laptops. Provision of laptops and access to the high speed wireless environment narrows the digital divide for our students, nearly three out of five of whom are economically disadvantaged and 80% of whom are minority (75% African American). Moving School from a Noun to a Verb will be implemented over a 3-year period for $1.25 per student per day.	CH-UH proposes to address Absolute Priority 3: to benchmark against the new Ohio Standards based on the national Common Core Standards following cohorts of students beginning with the 6th grade through their college career.

This proposal responds to Absolute Priority #3 and Competitive Priority #6, and is a Development Grant proposal. The proposed expansion of the SUCCESS Initiative (SI) is a collaborative program with a two-fold objective. The first objective is to increase the level of college readiness for targeted, at-risk 11th and 12th grade students (350 annually), using a case management model with college coaches embedded in seven target schools to provide daily support services through high school graduation. Coaches will then follow these students through their first 45 college credits. The second objective is to create a model for systemic change that will foster significant alignments between colleges and secondary schools, particularly in terms of aligned curricula, assessments and expectations, thus creating seamless transitions from one educational level to the other. The impact from both of these sets of services will be fewer students having to take developmental courses as incoming college freshmen. The outcome will be greater college graduation rates because students will be entering ?college ready.? The economy will benefit by having a skilled and educated workforce ready to move the country into the 21st century?s global economy. The Consortium has a 36-year history of providing educational access services across Massachusetts, and therefore is well positioned to work with the two public college partners, who tend to be the gateway into higher educaiuton for at-risk students.

Mathematical learning will be enhanced in this context via multiple pathways stemming from the implementation of the treatment (the integration of the games into the curricular/instructional environment of the classroom), namely:1.	Play of interactive games using research-based learning trajectories in all standards areas.2.	Enhancement of classroom instructional strategies due to teacher learning of said trajectories via professional development, training and mentoring3.	Individualization of game interactions, leading to optimal efficiency of learning, including student-specific activity levels, choice of language, and use of relevant themes.4.	Targeted actions by teachers and parents using student reports from the gaming software.The five-year project is based on two new developments: 1) current research in early mathematics learning and microdevelopment, early mathematics differences between socioeconomic (and other) groups, and their far-reaching effects on later educational outcomes, and 2) cutting-edge gaming software capabilities allowing unprecedented interactive flexibility and data-collection/reporting useful in formative assessment and differentiation or individualization of instruction.  Kids Play Math II is an extension (to grades K-1) of a current Office of Head Start-funded project creating such games for PreK with research-based supports for teachers and parents.

The Consortium has always held that learning is complex, and assessments should be, too.  This is no less true for students with high needs than for students from more privileged background. Instead of relying on standardized tests and the standardized teaching it produces, the Consortium has developed a system with required performance-based assessment tasks (PBATs) in English, social studies, science, and math. PBATs reflect the complexity of learning that Conley (2007) refers to in his work on college readiness-analyzing conflicting phenomena, supporting arguments with evidence, solving complex problems that have no obvious answer, and generally thinking deeply about what they are being taught.  These are the specific skills that Wagner (2008) argues are needed to prepare students for the 21st century.

College Preparatory Mathematics Educational Program (CPM) is proud to partner with teachersand administrators at five high schools in multiple states (WI, CA, ?) and evaluators at UC Davis on adevelopment grant for the RAISE-Math project. We will work with teachers and administrators to raise theachievement of students as we support schools transitioning their mathematics classrooms from teacher- tostudent-centered.Frequently, student-centered curricula have been implemented in hopes of changing teacher practice but thesuccess has been mixed; we propose instead to change practice prior to changing curriculum. First, teacherswill participate in professional development, including frequent coaching focused on student-centeredpractices. Each teacher will be coached once every two weeks while using the school?s standard curriculum.During the second year the student-centered CPM curriculum will be introduced with equally intensivecoaching and professional development. During the third year lead teachers from the school will be invited toattend coaching seminars allowing them to become coaches in their own districts. Throughout the project,administrators will participate in professional development aimed at understanding student-centeredclassrooms, supporting teachers and educating stakeholders.We expect several strongly favorable outcomes: participating teachers will become adept at teaching in astudent-centered way; students will demonstrate increased understanding of mathematics on state tests andproblem-based assessments; and significantly increased numbers of students will take additional mathematicsand science classes.

Project-based learning (PBL) will be the heart of this instructional approach. PBL uses technology and inquiry to engage students with issues and questions that are relevant to their lives. In these technology-based classrooms, teachers design rigorous projects aligned to state and district standards and customize them to their location and the interests of students. Students then work in teams to acquire and apply knowledge and skills to solve problems. This technological approach to PBL fundamentally changes the role of teacher and student.Project Goal:  Improve teacher and school leader effectiveness; increase student achievement.  This technologically based school model helps improve teacher and school leader effectiveness through neuroscience based professional development and educational hardware and software products. Students will be able to effectively assimilate their school curriculums, which in turn will enable them to stay in school, successfully graduate, and be adequately prepared for success in college and career.

Improve Academic Achievement",Washington,DC,20009,"""DC VOICE, and five partners (Alliance for Education, A+ Schools of Pittsburgh, Mobile Area Education Foundation, Bridgeport Public Education Fund, and Paterson Education Fund, collectively referred to as the ?Collaborative,? seeks funding to support an innovative six-city, community action research (CAR) program that addresses immediate and systemic barriers to student achievement and college and career readiness through coalition-building in traditionally marginalized communities. This program will develop methodology (for replication in other communities) tested in DC, which has lead to significant improvement in schools. CAR, as defined in this project, involves community volunteers in the collection of data affecting teaching and learning in public schools. The objectives are to: (1) implement the ?Ready Schools? and ?College Access andSuccess? projects; (2) improve these CAR efforts in each site; and (3) evaluate both the process and the outcomes across multiple years and all six sites to strengthen the evidence base and begin scaling up the process to other regions and States. The expected outcomes are: 1) the six sites will show significantly improved target outcomes; (2) all U.S. local education agencies (LEAs) will have access to tools, processes, and results via a web portal that will enable them to plan and implement effective action research in their own communities; and (3) a sufficient base of knowledge, data, and expertise to apply to a broader range of education reform issues. Key project features are: 1) community engagement capacity that can be appliedacross a multitude of needs; 2) the volunteer research component; 3) a web portal (uniquely interfacing with each user) to facilitate best practices, site-to-site technical assistance, volunteer management and training, research dissemination, and the ability for lay users to find meaningful information; and 4) the ability to test this model simultaneously across six cities.""",AP4: Persistently Low-Performing Schools,"CP6: College Access and Success College Access and Success, CP7: Unique Learning Needs, CP8: Rural LEAs",Nonprofit w/ consortium of schools,Development,3 years,3478510,No,"Washington, DC

Our hypothesis is the growth is directly attributed to use of a Coaching Model and the use of data to inform instruction (RTI). The process includes:1) using formative reading assessments from a state-adopted reading program to measure growth, 2) organizing/displaying data on a data wall, 3) use coach to facilitate data analysis meetings with teachers, and 4) teachers planning interventions for students to improve learning. The Coaching Model including the data wall process will be the core of the DNDATA Project. I3 funds will support fully implementing this successful Coaching Model that has shown high potential but has not been implemented district-wide. DN DATA will be an integrated assessment and intervention system that identifies students at risk of failure, monitors student progress, and provides evidenced-based interventions at multi-levels. The primary goal of the DN DATA Project is to implement data driven instruction in Pre-Kindergarten-12th grade classrooms using the Coaching Model in core subjects in all DNCUSD schools. A secondary goal of the DN DATA Project is to improve student performance and close the achievement gap between the subgroup and general student populations through promising practices of data analysis and coaching. DN DATA Project's first step will be to lay a foundation of professional development in Years 1 and 2 that will build a common knowledge base among administrators and teachers. PD will include a consultant Coach Trainer for ten teachers as full time coaches.

Supported by key organizational partners, DPPS will open 16 schools in Rhode Island's Blackstone Valley over the next 5 years.  As DPPS implements this growth strategy in Rhode Island-and as other emerging charter networks replicate nationwide-there is one key challenge to sustainable growth: the lack of school leaders ready and able to lead high-performing 'no excuses' schools.  To address this human capital shortage, DPPS and its applicant partners seek an i3 Development grant (under Absolute Priority I) to build an innovative new school leader training program-Leader U-that successfully identifies, recruits, develops, and rewards highly-effective school leaders to serve in Democracy Prep Public Schools and other Rhode Island public schools, thereby providing a scalable proof-point for a national approach to leadership development in education. In this application, DPPS proposes to: (1) Build Leader U as an academic program; (2) develop a school leader evaluation model for use statewide; and (3) conduct a rigorous evaluation of the impact of this programming and evaluation system on student achievement.  In so doing, DPPS will directly improve academic outcomes for 8,700 students, who will be enrolled in schools operated by Leader U fellows by 2016, and at least 100,000 more nationwide through dissemination of best practices and model replication assistance.

Our proposal seeks to pilot the use of the EXPLORE, PLAN and ACT as short-cycle assessments in order to adjust curriculum and instruction to increase the number and percentage of students who are prepared for college as defined by the benchmark scores set by the ACT in Reading, English, Math and Science.  While EMHS has met these benchmark scores on average in Reading and English, we have not yet in Math and Science.  Additionally, we have not yet met our goal of ensuring that each student meets the benchmark score in each subject.  Nationally, only 23% of students taking the ACT achieved the college readiness benchmark score in all four subject areas.  Achieving this score in all four subject areas would indicate that a student has a 75% probability of achieving a C or better and a 50% probability of achieving a B or better in a credit-bearing College English Composition, Algebra or Biology course. In addition to piloting the use of the EXPLORE, PLAN and ACT, East Mountain High School will work with Solution Tree to implement the strategies of Professional Learning Communities at Work, the Marzano Research Laboratory and McRel Research Laboratory to define essential course outlines, align curriculum to instructional activities and provide both teachers and administrators with professional development based on researched and tested best practices.

The key premise of the STEM STAR project is that students and educators must collaborate on a new, higher level if the goals of the i3 program reforms are to be met, sustained and brought to scale. STEM STAR?s student/teacher collaboration strategy is based on the Student Technology Leadership (STL) model developed by Generation Y and on a set of five strategies that include intensive professional development for STEM teachers, a Professional Learning Community, rural school emphasis, project-based inquiry, and student STEM leaders (SSLs).STEM STAR is an exceptional approach to lasting and transformative improvements in STEM teaching and learning because it will seek innovative solutions based on a student-educator collaboration model. Supported by moderate to strong prior educational research evidence, the STEM STAR model will distinguish itself from previous work by emphasizing STEM learning in rural middle schools and building on previous studies to strengthen the evidence that when students and teachers are given the opportunity to generate change and take ownership of that change, academic success follows.In each of 28 Washington state rural middle schools, a group of fifteen specially prepared SSLs will collaborate both face-to-face and online with STEM stakeholders (peers, teachers, scientists, researchers, content specialists, policy makers, and project administrators) to improve STEM achievement.
